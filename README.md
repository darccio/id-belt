I'm Dario Utility Belt

> Batman: "The true crimefighter always carries everything he needs in his utility belt, Robin."

This is my personal utility belt, a little repo to store those little scripts that help me to go through my own projects.

## Status
As long as they are published, that means they are tested for my own needs. Anyway, I love to share and I hope they can become full projects or to be useful to somebody. If you use and improve one of them, don't hesitate to ask me to pull your changes! Fork it on Github and go. Please make sure you're kosher with the UNLICENSE file before contributing.
